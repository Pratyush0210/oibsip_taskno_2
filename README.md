OASIS INFOBYTE Internship Task 2 contains one Python and one Tableau files.
## **Tableau File Description**
A Tableau dashboard that provides valuable insights into the unemployment situation in India during the period of 2019-20. This analysis sheds light on the significant rise in the unemployment rate between the months of April and June 2020, showcasing the direct impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the Indian labour market.

The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges worldwide, and India was no exception. As the nation implemented strict lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus, various sectors of the economy experienced significant disruptions. The consequence was a sudden surge in unemployment, which can be observed in the dashboard's compelling visualizations.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:
1️⃣ 𝐑𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐔𝐧𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞: The dashboard illustrates the sharp increase in the unemployment rate from April to June 2020. This rise indicates the challenges faced by businesses and the workforce, as many industries grappled with closures, reduced operations, and economic uncertainty.

2️⃣ 𝐅𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐨𝐟 𝐋𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞: The dashboard also showcases the decline in the labour participation rate during the same period. This metric highlights the decrease in the number of individuals actively seeking employment, indicating a loss of confidence and reduced job prospects amidst the lockdown measures.

3️⃣ 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐂𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐃-𝟏𝟗 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧: The correlation between the rise in unemployment and the fall in labour participation rate underscores the direct impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on India's labour market. The dashboard visually presents these interconnected trends, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to support job creation and economic recovery.

The purpose of sharing this Tableau dashboard is to foster a data-driven understanding of the unemployment situation in India during the critical period of April to June 2020. By visualizing these insights, we can collectively comprehend the far-reaching consequences of the pandemic and strive for effective solutions to rebuild our economy.

I encourage you to explore the dashboard and engage in meaningful discussions about the challenges faced by the workforce during the pandemic. Let us come together as professionals, thought leaders and change-makers to brainstorm innovative strategies that can help accelerate India's recovery and ensure a brighter future for all.


## **Python File Description**
I hope you're all doing well. An analysis I conducted on unemployment data in India, focused on the impact of the COVID lockdown on employment. Using Python libraries Seaborn and Plotly, I explored estimated employment, unemployment rate (%), and labour participation rate (%). Let's dive in! 📊

After importing Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly, I loaded the unemployment dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for easy exploration and manipulation. Employing Seaborn, I created a line plot that showcased the estimated employment and unemployment rates over time. The x-axis represented the time period (e.g., months or years), while the y-axis displayed the rates as percentages. Customizing the plot's aesthetics ensured a clear understanding and visual appeal.

Utilizing the same dataset, I extracted the labour participation rate data and employed similar data manipulation and visualization steps. With Seaborn, I crafted a bar plot illustrating the labour participation rate trends. The x-axis denoted the time period, and the y-axis represented the rate as a percentage. Plotly's interactive features enhanced the plot, enabling users to obtain detailed information by hovering over the bars.

🔍 𝐂𝐎𝐕𝐈𝐃 𝐋𝐨𝐜𝐤𝐝𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬:

1. Steep decline in estimated employment rates during the lockdown period due to business closures and economic slowdown.
2. Significant rise in the unemployment rate, reflecting the challenges faced by job seekers during this challenging period.
3. Adverse effect on the labour participation rate as individuals faced difficulties in finding employment opportunities.

🌐 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧:
Using Python libraries such as Seaborn and Plotly, I effectively analyzed and visualized unemployment data, focusing on estimated employment, unemployment rates (%), and labour participation rate trends. By exploring the impact of the COVID lockdown on jobs in India, we can gain valuable insights into the challenges faced by the workforce.
